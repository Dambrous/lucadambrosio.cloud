                Hello, everyone! My name is Luca D'Ambrosio, and I'm thrilled to
                have the opportunity to introduce myself. At twenty years old, I
                hail from the beautiful town of Pescara in Abruzzo, Italy, born
                on July 25, 2001.

                I kick-started my journey into the world of technology by
                obtaining my high school diploma from the esteemed "Galileo
                Galilei Scientific High School". It was during this time that my
                passion for IT truly ignited. Eager to explore the endless
                possibilities of programming, I knew I had found my future and
                my greatest passion.

                Immediately after graduating, I embarked on an exciting
                adventure at the University of L'Aquila, where I delved into the
                captivating studies of "Computer and Software Engineering". The
                program opened up a world of opportunities for me, and I
                couldn't wait to immerse myself in this fascinating field.
                Within a year, my thirst for practical experience led me to the
                vibrant city of Rome.

                My programming journey has been enriched by my experiences with
                Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub, Docker, and Java. I find
                great joy in mastering these tools, and they have become an
                integral part of my skill set. Furthermore, I am continually
                expanding my horizons by studying other languages such as
                TypeScript and ReactJS in my spare time. I believe in
                comprehensive knowledge, and I am determined to excel not only
                in back-end development but also in the exciting world of
                front-end programming.

                Navigating through the challenges of university education, I
                made a bold decision to adapt to the changing circumstances.
                Unable to follow traditional in-person training, I opted for a
                "telematic" approach, continuing my studies in Computer
                Engineering with a specific focus on databases at "eCampus
                University". This decision has allowed me to continue my
                educational journey while embracing the latest advancements in
                technology.

                problem-solving abilities, and meticulous attention to detail to
                every project I undertake. I thrive in collaborative
