            I'm often chased by bugs like they're my shadow, but unlike Peter Pan, I don't have a coding fairy
            to help me fly out of trouble. Sometimes developer and huge nerd. Now at

                    Hello, everyone! My name is Luca D'Ambrosio, and I'm thrilled to have
                    the opportunity to introduce myself. At twenty years old, I hail from the
                    beautiful town of Pescara in Abruzzo, Italy, born on July 25, 2001.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kick-started my journey into the world of technology by obtaining my
                    high school diploma from the esteemed "Galileo Galilei Scientific High
                    School."It was during this time that my passion for IT truly ignited. Eager
                    to explore the endless possibilities of programming, I knew I had found
                    my future and my greatest passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Immediately after graduating, I embarked on an exciting adventure at the
                    University of L'Aquila, where I delved into the captivating studies of
                    "Computer and Software Engineering." The program opened up a world
                    of opportunities for me, and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in this
                    fascinating field.Within a year, my thirst for practical experience led
                    me to the vibrant city of Rome.

                <p>
                    I landed an incredible role as a Back-End Web Developer at
                    <a class="custom-link" href="https://www.rapsodoo.com/it" style="color:black">"Rapsodoo"</a>, a
                    renowned company.
                    It has been an exhilarating journey so far, working alongside talented professionals and
                    contributing to the development of cutting-edge web solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My programming journey has been enriched by my experiences with
                    Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub, Docker, and Java. I find great joy
                    in mastering these tools, and they have become an integral part of my
                    skill set. Furthermore, I am continually expanding my horizons by
                    studying other languages such as TypeScript and ReactJS in my spare
                    time. I believe in comprehensive knowledge, and I am determined to excel
                    not only in back-end development but also in the exciting world of
                    front-end programming

                    Navigating through the challenges of university education, I made a bold
                    decision to adapt to the changing circumstances. Unable to follow
                    traditional in-person training, I opted for a "telematic" approach,
                    continuing my studies in Computer Engineering with a specific focus on
                    databases at"ECampus University." This decision has allowed me to
                    continue my educational journey while embracing the latest advancements in technology.

                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I bring a strong work ethic,
                    problem-solving abilities, and meticulous attention to detail to every
                    project I undertake. I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing
                    effective communication and teamwork as essential ingredients for
                    success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am thrilled about the prospect of joining a dynamic and
                    forward-thinking organization, where I can apply my skills, fuel my
                    passion for technology, and contribute to groundbreaking projects. I am
                    confident that my diverse experiences, relentless drive for growth, and
                    unwavering commitment make me an excellent fit for any team.
